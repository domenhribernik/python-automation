Practical Example in Your Case
A customer hasn’t purchased in 3 months → Jira moves them to "Needs Follow-up."
A sales rep calls them and updates the status → Jira tracks this.
On Monday, Confluence updates automatically with a report:
"This week, 50 customers need follow-ups."
"John has 10 customers to call, Sarah has 5."
"Follow-ups are up 20% from last week."
Your boss checks Confluence instead of asking you how sales are doing.

Ideas:
- Check customers weekly
- Monday report includes how many customers need to be contacted
- Friday report tracks the work done during the week

Issues:
- Token will expire after 1 year, how to prevent this
- Need to bulk create issues - fix if we find it appropriate
