# jira-automation

## Overview

This project reads data from Google Sheets or a local CSV file and uploads each column as a Jira issue after filtering the data. The issues are then sorted into the correct Kanban status. The program also reads the issues already in a status to avoid duplication. Currently, it works for the following rows:
- Customer Name
- Last Transaction Date
- Last Transaction Amount
- Email
- SMS
